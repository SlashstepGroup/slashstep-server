# Installing Slashstep Server on Windows
> [!WARNING]
> Slashstep Group recommends containerizing Slashstep Server to protect your computer. If you plan to use Slashstep Server in a production environment, consider installing it with [Podman](./installing-slashstep-server-with-podman.md) instead.

## Prerequisites
* A Windows computer with access to the Internet
* A server running [PostgreSQL 18](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
* [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/), if you're building Slashstep Server from source

## Steps
### Step 1: Get the binary
You can download the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/SlashstepGroup/slashstep-server/releases) on the GitHub repository.

If you'd like, you can also clone the repository and run `cargo build` in the project root.

### Step 2: Set environment variables

### Step 3: Set up Slashstep Server through the console
From here, you can set up Slashstep Server through the console. If you're on Windows, open the app by pressing the binary.
