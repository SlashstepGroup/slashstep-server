# Slashstep Server
**Slashstep Server** is the backend of Slashstep, an open-source, project and issue tracking software.

## Features
### Issue management
* **Create and manage work:** Keep track of what matters with items.
* **Manage dependencies:** Link items together with connections.

### Problem management
* **Track and log problems:** You can use your client to send problems to Slashstep Server.
* **Send requests for approval:** Admins can respond to requests, and Slashstep Server can automatically run actions for you.

### Customization
* **Add more with third-party apps:** Most endpoints are compatible with apps. Apps can extend Slashstep Server without you having to change the core code.
* **Categorize with fields:** All fields are customizable and hidable.
<!-- * **Automate with workflows:** Automatically run actions after certain events without having to host an additional server. -->

### Security and compliance
* **Audit activity with logs:** Slashstep Server automatically logs endpoint activity.
* **Manage access on all levels:** From the server-level to the field-level, Slashstep Server features multiple levels of access for maximum granularity.

## Getting started

## Contributing
* **Star this repo:** It's just one click and it's probably the easiest thing to do on this list. Your star goes a long way.
* **Report bugs:** If something wrong happens, let us know! Sometimes we try to proactively find bugs; but odds are, you use the app differently than we do, and see issues we don't initially see. A helpful report can make the app better for everyone. 
* **Squash bugs and implement features:** Check the [issues](https://github.com/SlashstepGroup/slashstep_server/issues), fork the repo, and bring it home with a pull request. If you like TypeScript more, consider contributing to our [web client](https://github.com/SlashstepGroup/web-client) repository.
* **Improve the documentation:** If you took a look at our docs and thought a guide could make it better, write that guide! Fix that typo. Fork the repo, and we'll take a look. We appreciate you making the app more concise and understandable for the average person.
* **Follow us on social media:** We're on [Bluesky](https://bsky.social/profile/beastslash.com) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/7Aekbhp2JS).
* **Give us feedback:** Let us know how you use Slashstep Server.
